In our case, we made objects `John` and `Lily`.\n\n## The `Object()` constructor\n\nWe can create objects using `Object()` constructor function.\n\n```javascript\n// using Object()\nconst John = new Object({\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: \"23\",\n});\n\n// Result: {name: \"John\", age: \"23\"}\n```\n\n- If it is not provided with any parameters it creates an empty object.\n\n## The `create()` method\n\nLet's say you want to create another object from our `John` Object.\n\nHere we can use the `create()` method available on the `Object`.\n\n```javascript\nconst anotherPerson = Object.create(John);\n```\n\nNow we have all the properties and methods which were available to `John` Object in our new object.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Different ways to create objects in JavaScript","description":"Learn how to create objects using constructor functions, literals, create(), etc","keywords":"object literals,constructor function in javascript,object constructor,create method in javascript,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 16, 2020","link":"different-ways-to-create-objects-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
