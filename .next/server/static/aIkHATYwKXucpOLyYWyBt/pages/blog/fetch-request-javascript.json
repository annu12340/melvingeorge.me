The `fetch()` method available in JavaSript helps us to fetch data from this endpoint and it is very easy to do 🦄.\n\n## `fetch()` method\n\nLet's use a free API endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to get some blog data.\n\n```javascript\n// fetch blogs\nfetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\");\n```\n\nWe are just passing the endpoint to fetch the blog posts to the `fetch()` method.\n\nBut wait, we are requesting for data in the endpoint! How are going to get the data? 🤔\n\nTo get the data, we need to attach a `then()` method to the `fetch()` method, because fetch methods are asynchronous and only returns a [Promise](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/promises-javascript) if the request is successful or unsuccessful.\n\nInside the `then()` method we will provide a callback function to process the response or the blog data coming from the server.\n\nLets add the `then()` method.\n\n```javascript\n// fetch blogs\nfetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\").then((response) => {\n  /* We need to do some stuffs here */\n});\n```\n\nWhen we get the response from the API endpoint we are getting something called a `Response` object which is of no use to us because we won't be able to work with that.\n\nSo We need to convert the `Response` object into something we can work with, like JSON or a text.\n\nTo convert into JSON, there is a method called `json()` available in the response object.\n\nLet's convert the `Response` object into JSON.\n\n```javascript\n// fetch blogs\nfetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\").then((response) => {\n  // convert it to json and return the promise\n  return response.json();\n});\n```\n\nSince `json()` method also returns a promise lets return that promise and use another `then()` method to really work with the JSON.\n\n```javascript\n// fetch blogs\nfetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\n  .then((response) => {\n    // convert it to json and return the promise\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then((json) => {\n    // do some fun things with the json we got\n    // eg: show the blogs to the user\n    console.log(json);\n  });\n```\n\nAlso, remember to add a `catch()` method at the end of the chain of `then()` methods to catch any errors for unsuccessful requests.\n\n```javascript\n// fetch blogs\nfetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\n  .then((response) => {\n    // convert it to json and return the promise\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then((json) => {\n    // do some fun things with the json we got\n    // eg: show the blogs to the user\n    console.log(json);\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    // do error handling\n    console.log(err);\n  });\n```\n\nYay 🤩. We got all the blogs.\n\nLike `json()` you can also use:\n\n- `text()`: for converting it to text\n- `formData()`: getting an form data as an object\n- `blob()`: converting to blob format\n\n## Using fetch in Node.js Environment\n\nAs of writing this post, Node.js doesn't support the `fetch()` method out of the box.\n\nSo you may need to install a package called `node-fetch` to achieve this.\n\n```bash\nnpm install node-fetch --save\n```\n\nThen you need to require it in the files where you need to use the `fetch()` method.\n\n```javascript\n// require node-fetch\nconst fetch = require(\"node-fetch\");\n```\n\nThen you can do everything in Node.js just like we did in the browser.\n\n---\n\nThis is just a starter on how to request data using `fetch()`, You can also send data using fetch. Let's discuss this in another blog post 😃.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to fetch data using JavaScript?","description":"Learn how to use the fetch() method to get data using JavaScript.","keywords":"fetch(),fetch method,fetch request,request data,API,request,request data from server,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"July 2, 2020","link":"fetch-request-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
