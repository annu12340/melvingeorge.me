Gracefully handling these errors makes the application smooth and is good for better user experience instead to just error out the whole application making it unusable.\n\nJavascript provides `try`...`catch`, and `finally` to work with errors which may happen at runtime.\n\n## the `try` ... `catch` statement\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we ask the user if his/her age is 18 years so that we can provide access to features on the application.\n\n```javascript\n// get age input from user\nconst age = getUserAge();\n```\n\nafter getting the age input we need to check whether the entered age is 18 years.\n\n```javascript\n// get age input from user\nconst age = getUserAge();\n\nif (age >= 18) {\n  console.log(\"Access Granted ✅\");\n} else {\n  // do error handling\n}\n```\n\nIn the `else` block we need to throw an error with the message `Access Denied 🚫`.\n\nWe can use the `throw` keyword and `Error` class to throw an error. The `Error` class accepts a `string` as the definition of the error happened.\n\n```javascript\n// get age input from user\nconst age = getUserAge();\n\nif (age >= 18) {\n  console.log(\"Access Granted ✅\");\n} else {\n  // do error handling\n  throw new Error(\"Access Denied 🚫\");\n}\n```\n\nLet's now wrap our `if`...`else` block in a `try`... `catch` block.\n\n```javascript\n// get age input from user\nconst age = getUserAge();\n\n// wrap in try catch\ntry {\n  if (age >= 18) {\n    console.log(\"Access Granted ✅\");\n  } else {\n    // do error handling\n    throw new Error(\"Access Denied 🚫\");\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  // dsiplay error to user\n  console.log(e.message); // Access Denied 🚫\n}\n```\n\nIf an error is thrown in runtime the `catch` catches it and is supplied an `Error` object. The error message we provided will be available in the `message` property on the `Error` object.\n\n## The `finally` statement\n\nThe `finally` statement is added to the end of the `try`...`catch` statement. The block of code inside `finally` will be run regardless of `try`...`catch` statement.\n\n```javascript\n// get age input from user\nconst age = getUserAge();\n\n// wrap in try catch\ntry {\n  if (age >= 18) {\n    console.log(\"Access Granted ✅\");\n  } else {\n    // do error handling\n    throw new Error(\"Access Denied 🚫\");\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  // dsiplay error to user\n  console.log(e.message); // Access Denied 🚫\n} finally {\n  // will be executed regardless of try...catch\n  console.log(\"This block of code will be executed anyway. 🤓\");\n  // execute some cleanup code\n}\n```\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"try, catch and finally in JavaScript","description":"Learn how to handle errors gracefully in JavaScript","keywords":"try-catch,finally,errors in javascript,catching errors,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"July 5, 2020","link":"try-catch-finally"}},"__N_SSG":true}
