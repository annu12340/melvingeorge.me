Promises don't block other processes and run in the JavaScript's `Event loop`.\n\n## Create a new Promise\n\nTo create a `Promise` you have to create a `Promise` object.\n\n```javascript\n// Create a new promise\nconst promise = new Promise();\n```\n\nYou need to pass a function with 2 parameters to resolve the task and to reject the task to the constructor function.\n\nNow, Let's create the function to run.\n\n```javascript\n// Create a function to run.\n// Let's simulate getting a result\n// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function\n\nconst giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {\n  // You can also do a fetch request\n  // from a server to get some data.\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve(\"We got the data :) \");\n  }, 3000);\n};\n```\n\nA lot is going on these lines 🤯 Let's understand each step by step. 🧙‍♀️\n\nHere we have a function called `giveResultAfterThreeSeconds` with 2 parameters called `resolve` and `reject`.\nBoth these parameters are references to function which can be invoked while running the task.\n\nThe `resolve` function is invoked when we got the desired result and the `reject` function is invoked whenever there is an error while running the task.\n\nIn the body of the function, we have a `setTimeout` function to simulate waiting for 3 seconds.\n\nAfter 3 seconds the `resolve` function is called with a value of `We got the data :)`.\n\nWe would also be expecting some kind of error happening in the future while running our task, thus we need the `reject` function to invoke it with an error value.\n\nHere we are not using the `reject` function since we don't have the possibility of `setTimeout` function failing.\n\nThe `reject` function can be used when getting some data from a server where we have the possibility of getting an error eg: Internal Server Error, Not Found, etc.\n\nNow let's give this function to our promise.\n\n```javascript\n// Create a function to run.\n// Let's simulate getting a result\n// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function\n\nconst giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {\n  // You can also do a fetch request\n  // from a server to get some data.\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve(\"We got the data :)\");\n  }, 3000);\n};\n\n// Create a new promise and pass the function\nconst promise = new Promise(giveResultAfterThreeSeconds);\n```\n\nSo we defined our function and made a promise. But how do we use it?\n\nTo use it we can use the `then`, `catch` methods available in our `promise` object.\n\n```javascript\n// Create a function to run.\n// Let's simulate getting a result\n// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function\n\nconst giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {\n  // You can also do a fetch request\n  // from a server to get some data.\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve(\"We got the data :)\");\n  }, 3000);\n};\n\n// Create a new promise and pass the function\nconst promise = new Promise(giveResultAfterThreeSeconds);\n\n// then and catch\npromise\n  .then(\n    (resolvedValue) => {\n      console.log(resolvedValue); //  Result ==> We got the data :)\n    },\n    (rejectedValue) => {\n      console.log(rejectedValue); // will be invoked if there is a rejected value\n    }\n  ) //\n  .catch((rejectedValue) => console.log(errorValue)); // will be invoked if there is a rejected value\n```\n\n- The `then` method is used to get a resolved value as well a rejected value, It accepts 2 callbacks The first callback function refers to the resolved value's callback function and the second refers to the rejected value's if there is one. The `then` method can also be chained.\n\n- The `catch` method is used to receive a rejected value. It accepts a callback function for rejected value and the function is supplied with a value from the `reject` function.\n\nWe will be discussing more about `Promises` in future Posts. Well, Its a start.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to Make a Promise in JavaScript?","description":"Learn how to make promises and work with async data in JavaScript","keywords":"promises,then,catch,method,fetch,async,asynchronous,javascript,callback,callback hell","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 27, 2020","link":"promises-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
