{"pageProps":{"content":"# How to inherit methods in JavaScript?\n<p className=\"date\">Published June 25, 2020</p>\n\nWe already discussed inheriting properties in a previous post on [How to inherit properties in JavaScript?](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/inherit-properties-javascript)\n\nToday we will be discussing on inheriting methods in JavaScript.\n\nConsider our old class `Vehicle` from our [previous post](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/inherit-properties-javascript).\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n```\n\nLet's now add a method called `start()` to the `Vehicle` class.\n\nIt is better and a convention to add methods to the prototype chain of the class.\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n\n// add a method to the prototype chain\nVehicle.prototype.start = () => {\n  console.log(\"Vehicle started\");\n};\n```\n\nOk. Everything is fine till now. 😃\n\nNow, let's make another class called `Car` and inherit all the properties as well as our methods from the `Vehicle` base class.\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n\n// add a method to the prototype chain\nVehicle.prototype.start = () => {\n  console.log(\"Vehicle started\");\n};\n\n// Car class\nconst Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);\n  this.name = name;\n};\n```\n\nIf you recall from our previous post on [How to inherit properties in JavaScript?](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/inherit-properties-javascript), then you would know that the `Vehicle.call()` is the method used to inherit properties from the `Vehicle` base class.\n\nLet's create an object called `Audi`.\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n\n// add a method to the prototype chain\nVehicle.prototype.start = () => {\n  console.log(\"Vehicle started\");\n};\n\n// Car class\nconst Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);\n  this.name = name;\n};\n\n// create object Audi\nconst Audi = new Car(\"Audi\", \"Car\", 2020, 4);\n```\n\nBut the problem here is that we cannot invoke the `start()` method which is defined in the `Vehicle` class. It is because the `start()` method is not inherited using the `call()` method from `Vehicle` class. Only properties are inherited.\n\nSo, let's inherit the methods.\n\nTo inherit methods first we need to point our `Car` class prototype to our `Vehicle` base class prototype.\n\nCurrently, the `Car` class prototype is pointing to itself.\n\nWe achieve this using the [Object.create()](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/different-ways-to-create-objects-javascript) static method.\n\n## Note: You should this before creating an object from our `Car` class.\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n\n// add a method to the prototype chain\nVehicle.prototype.start = () => {\n  console.log(\"Vehicle started\");\n};\n\n// Car class\nconst Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);\n  this.name = name;\n};\n\n// point prototype of Car class to Vehicle class\nCar.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);\n\n// create object Audi\nconst Audi = new Car(\"Audi\", \"Car\", 2020, 4);\n```\n\nOk. One more thing. 🦄\n\nWhen we changed our prototype of `Car` class to `Vehicle` class prototype, the constructor of Car was also changed in the process.\n\nWe need to change it back to the `Car` constructor otherwise it may cause errors in the long run.\n\nLet's achieve this using the [Object.defineProperty](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/make-property-immutable-objects-javascript).\n\n```javascript\n// Vehicle base class\nconst Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  this.type = type;\n  this.year = year;\n  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;\n};\n\n// add a method to the prototype chain\nVehicle.prototype.start = () => {\n  console.log(\"Vehicle started\");\n};\n\n// Car class\nconst Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {\n  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);\n  this.name = name;\n};\n\n// point prototype of Car class to Vehicle class\nCar.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);\n\n// change the constructor back to Car class constructor\nObject.defineProperty(Car.prototype, \"constructor\", {\n  value: Car,\n  enumerable: false,\n  writable: true,\n});\n\n// create object Audi\nconst Audi = new Car(\"Audi\", \"Car\", 2020, 4);\n```\n\n## Note:\n\n- The `Object.defineProperty()` creates a new value called `constructor` in the `Car` class prototype and put its value to the `Car` class itself, just what we needed.\n\n- Setting the `enumerable` property to `false` helps to avoid it being shown while looping.\n- Setting the `writable` property to `true` makes it mutable.\n\nNow we can invoke the `start()` method from our `Audi` object.\n\n```javascript\nAudi.start(); // Vehicle started\n```\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to inherit methods in JavaScript?","description":"Learn how to inherit methods in vanilla JavaScript","keywords":"inherit,methods,objects,inherit methods,properties,inheritance,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 25, 2020","link":"inherit-methods-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
