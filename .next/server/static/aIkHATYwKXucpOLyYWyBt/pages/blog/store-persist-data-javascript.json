We can store data into it in a key/pair format.\n\n## Storing Data\n\nTo store data we need to use the `setItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.\n\nLet's store our user's names.\n\n```javascript\nconst name = \"John Doe\";\n\n// storing user's name\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"name\", name);\n```\n\nThe method accepts:\n\n- the name of the key as the first argument\n- the value to store as the second argument\n\n## Get Stored Data\n\nTo get the stored data we need to use the `getItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.\n\nLet's retrieve the stored user's name\n\n```javascript\n// get stored name\nconst name = localStorage.getItem(\"name\");\n```\n\nThe method accepts:\n\n- the name of the key as an argument.\n- the method returns the stored value for the key name supplied\n\n## Removing Stored Data\n\nTo remove stored data we need to use the `removeItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.\n\nLet's remove the stored user's name\n\n```javascript\n// remove the stored user's name\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\"name\");\n```\n\nThe method accepts:\n\n- the key name to remove as an argument.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to store and persist data in JavaScript?","description":"Learn how to use the localStorage browser API","keywords":"localStorage,setItem method,getItem method,removeItem method,store data in javascript,persist data,javascript,","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"July 4, 2020","link":"store-persist-data-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
