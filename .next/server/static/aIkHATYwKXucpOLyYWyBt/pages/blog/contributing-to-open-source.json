{"pageProps":{"content":"# Getting started with contributing to open source projects\n<p className=\"date\">Published June 28, 2020</p>\n\n![wizard emoji](main.jpg)\n\nI have always loved open source since I started learning web development. Every one of us uses open source products, libraries directly or indirectly and even big companies rely on it for their huge successes.\n\nJavaScript language itself is known for introducing an explosion in several open-source libraries.\n\nI started contributing to open source projects 2 years back and from there I haven't stopped contributing to open source.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the platforms where huge open-source projects and discussions are conducted. There are many other platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) etc.\n\n## How can I start contributing to Open source?\n\nWell, if you know Github and working with Git technologies, It's easy to get started.\n\nIf you like a library you are using to build projects in your daily life. Try contributing to that library since you already have some familiarity with the library.\n\nFor example, If you love React.js ( Framework for creating web application), Go to their [Github project](https://github.com/facebook/react) and look for bugs in issues section or if you have a new idea you can even make a pull request to discuss your concept. No need to shy away from asking questions. Every open source communities are welcoming and friendly 🤓.\n\n![issues](github-issues.png)\n\nFor everybody those who are getting started. There will be issues listed as a `good first issue` or `good first contribution`.\n\n![good first issue](good-first-issue.png)\n\nMozilla has been encouraging open source activities for a long time, they even have one website called [Codetribute](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/) to help beginners get started with open source contribution. I use this website most of the time.\n\nThere another one called [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and a lot more sites.\n\n## What are the benefits?\n\nA lot 🎊!!!\n\n- Its fun and Your programming life go to a whole new level 😉.\n\n- You can become a better programmer and learn many practical usages and cases by contributing to open source projects. 🥳\n\n- You can connect with many great developers from around the world and become part of the community. 🤓\n\n- If you contribute to open source you can get swags and goodies 🎩, check out this website for upcoming open source events for goodies [DevSwag](https://devswag.io/).\n\n- contributing to open source projects adds a great value to your resume too as it shows the recruiter that you are an eligible candidate. 🌍\n\n### BONUS 💖\n\nThere's a website called [Mozillians](https://mozillians.org) where you can get vouched and recognized by other Mozilla members if you actively contribute to Mozilla Foundation projects.\n\nAfter contributing to a Mozilla project ask the member you were working with kindly to vouch for the contribution you made in the project in your Mozillian profile.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Getting started with contributing to open source projects","description":"Level up your programming life with open source 🤓","keywords":"open source projects,contribute,contributing to open source,open-source,Mozilla,mozillians,GitHub,git,issues,pull request,pr","category":"Resource","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 28, 2020","link":"contributing-to-open-source"}},"__N_SSG":true}
