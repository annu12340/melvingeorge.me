{"pageProps":{"content":"# How to make an object immutable in JavaScript?\n<p className=\"date\">Published June 21, 2020</p>\n\nTo make an object read only or immutable you can use the `Object.freeze()` method.\n\n---\n\nConsider this object,\n\n```javascript\nconst Car = {\n  name: \"Audi\",\n  year: \"2020\",\n};\n```\n\nWe don't want any more properties to be added to this `Car` object.\n\nLet's use the `Object.freeze()` method to achieve this.\n\n```javascript\nconst Car = {\n  name: \"Audi\",\n  year: \"2020\",\n};\n\n// make car object immutable\nObject.freeze(Car);\n```\n\nNow if you try to add or change any properties in the `Car` object, it will throw an error in strict mode.\n\n```javascript\nconst Car = {\n  name: \"Audi\",\n  year: \"2020\",\n};\n\n// make car object immutable\nObject.freeze(Car);\n\n// try to add a new property\nCar.engineType = \"BS-VI\"; // error in strict mode\n```\n\n- The `Object.freeze()` method accepts the object to make it immutable as the parameter.\n- The method returns the same object which is passed into it.\n- Cannot add or modify any properties and methods after calling the method.\n- It also restricts any modification to the prototype.\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to make an object immutable in JavaScript?","description":"Learn the usage of Object.freeze() method in JavaScript","keywords":"Object.freeze method,make object read only,immutable object,object,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 21, 2020","link":"make-objects-immutable-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
