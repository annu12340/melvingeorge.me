We can do the verification check for OTP in the function body of the `checkOTP` event.\n\n```javascript\nOTP.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n  if (e.target.value.length >= 6) {\n    const checkOTP = new Event(\"checkOTP\");\n    OTP.dispatchEvent(checkOTP);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n- The `input` event is invoked whenever the user enters the text into the input field.\n\n- It first checks to see if the length of the text is greater than or equal to 6. If false, it returns.\n\n- If true, then it creates a new `Event` object called `checkOTP` for which we have already attached a listener to the `OTP` element.\n\n- The `checkOTP` `Event` object is then passed to\n  the `dispatchEvent()` function and finally invoking the `checkOTP` listener programmatically.\n\n## Output\n\n![OTP UI](final-render.gif)\n\n### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.\n\n---\n","frontMatter":{"title":"How to trigger events programmatically in JavaScript?","description":"Trigger events programmatically using dispatchEvent method in JavaScript","keywords":"trigger events in javascript,javascript","category":"JavaScript","author":"MELVIN GEORGE","date":"June 10, 2020","link":"trigger-events-programatically-javascript"}},"__N_SSG":true}
