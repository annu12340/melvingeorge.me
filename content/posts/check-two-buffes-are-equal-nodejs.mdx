To check whether 2 `Buffer` instances are equal, We can use the `equals()` method in the `Buffer` Instance in Node.js.

Let's say we have 2 buffers, one made from the string `Hello World` and another buffer made from Hex code `48656c6c6f20576f726c64` ( this is a hex representation of the string `Hello World` 🦄).

```javascript
// String buffer
const strBuff = Buffer.from("Hello World", "utf-8");

// Hex Buffer
const hexBuff = Buffer.from("48656c6c6f20576f726c64", "hex");
```

Now let's check if both buffers made from the string and the hex are equal using the `equals()` method in the `strBuff` buffer object.

```javascript
// String buffer
const strBuff = Buffer.from("Hello World", "utf-8");

// Hex Buffer
const hexBuff = Buffer.from("48656c6c6f20576f726c64", "hex");

// check if both buffers are equal
const isEqual = strBuff.equals(hexBuff);

/*
    The method will return true
    because both buffers have the same content
    even though their encoding is different
*/
console.log(isEqual); // true
```

- The method accepts a valid buffer as an argument.
- It will return boolean `true` if the buffers are equal and `false` if not.
