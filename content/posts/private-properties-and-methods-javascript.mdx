Private properties and methods are those which can be accessed only in the class.

These properties and methods are not inherited.

**To make a property or a method in a class private, you need to use the `#` symbol before the property name or method name.**

### ⚠️ NOTE: Private property and methods is a new addition to JavaScript. Use with caution.

```javascript
class User {
  // private property
  #category = "User";

  // public property
  isAlive = true;

  // private method
  #checkUserAlive() {
    return isAlive;
  }
}
```

Here you can see that we added a special symbol `#` to the property `category` and method `checkUserAlive()` method.

Now if you try to access the private property or method outside the class it will throw an error.

```javascript
class User {
  // private property
  #category = "User";

  // public property
  isAlive = true;

  // private method
  #checkUserAlive() {
    return isAlive;
  }
}

// create a object
const john = new User();

// try to access private property category
console.log(john.#category); // error

// try to call checkUserAlive() private method
console.log(john.#checkUserAlive()); // error
```

You can only use the private properties and methods for usage within the class only.
