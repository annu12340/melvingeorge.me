Objects are a way of holding related data and code.

---

## Using Objects literals

Objects can be created using literals.

To create an object literal define a variable and assign it with curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
// object literal
const Person = {};
```

You can also add properties and functions to the `Person` object.

Let's add `name` property and `sayHello` function to the `Person` object.

```javascript
const Person = {
  name: "John",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Hey, How are you?");
  },
};
```

## Using Constructor Functions

Objects can be created using constructor functions.

```javascript
// constructor function
const Person = function () {
  name = this.name;
  age = this.age;
};
```

Here we have a function called `Person`, these are called constructor functions.

Now let's make an object from this constructor function.

```javascript
const Person = function (name, age) {
  name = this.name;
  age = this.age;
};

// making object from constructor function
const John = new Person("John", "23"); // Result: { name: "John", age: "23"}

const Lily = new Person("Lily", "20"); // Result: {name: "Lily", age: "20"}
```

- To create new objects from a constructor function we have to use the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function name.
- Constructor functions are the blueprint on how to make an object
- Names of constructor function start with a capital letter, in this case, `Person`.
- Constructor functions accept parameters to make objects with data, in our case we have parameters `name` and `age` which is then assigned to name and age variables inside the function.
- The `this` keyword refers to the created object itself. In our case, we made objects `John` and `Lily`.

## The `Object()` constructor

We can create objects using `Object()` constructor function.

```javascript
// using Object()
const John = new Object({
  name: "John",
  age: "23",
});

// Result: {name: "John", age: "23"}
```

- If it is not provided with any parameters it creates an empty object.

## The `create()` method

Let's say you want to create another object from our `John` Object.

Here we can use the `create()` method available on the `Object`.

```javascript
const anotherPerson = Object.create(John);
```

Now we have all the properties and methods which were available to `John` Object in our new object.
