Let's consider an object called `John`.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 32,
  bio: "John Doe is a great guy",
};
```

We can get all the properties in this object using the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 32,
  bio: "John Doe is a great guy",
};

// get all property names
const arr = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(John);

/*

Result:
-------

["name", "age", "bio"]

*/
```

- The `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method accepts the object to get all the property names as the parameter.
- It returns an array containing the property names.
