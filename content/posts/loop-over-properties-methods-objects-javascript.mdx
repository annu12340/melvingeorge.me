Looping over properties and methods can be achieved by combining `for...of` expression and `Object.entries()` method.

Let's say you have an object `John` with properties `name` and `age`.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};
```

Now let's loop over this object.

First, let's convert our object into an array using the `Object.entries()` method.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// convert object into an array
const arr = Object.entries(John);
```

The `arr` variable now contains the key and value as an inner array in its index positions as shown below.

```javascript
[
  ["name", "John Doe"],
  ["age", 23],
];
```

Now you can loop over the array using the `for...of` expression.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// convert object into an array
const arr = Object.entries(John);

// loop over array
for (let [key, value] of arr) {
  console.log(key, ":", value);
}
```

You can use the array destructuring to get the value when looping over the array.
