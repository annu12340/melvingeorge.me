A `Symbol` in javascript is a unique identifier and primitive datatype just like `Number`, `String`, `Boolean` primitive datatypes.

This was added to the ES6 version of JavaScript.

So why do we even need this new datatype `Symbol`?.

To answer that question let me tell you one problem, modern web applications work with the help of third-party libraries whether it may be for the animation of content, managing state of applications, rendering of content, etc.

So with that comes the problem of naming conflicts among these third-party libraries.

To solve that we could use the `Symbol` datatype.

Consider this object from a third-party library.

```javascript
// third party library object
const thirdPartyLibraryObject = {
  name: "example",
};
```

Now if I wanted to add the same property called `name` i could just add that using the `.` (dot operator). But the problem is that we will be overriding actual `name` property in `thirdPartyLibraryObject` instead of adding a new property to it.

```javascript
// third party library object
const thirdPartyLibraryObject = {
  name: "example",
};

// name is overidden
thirdPartyLibraryObject.name = "example2";

console.log(thirdPartyLibraryObject); // example 2
```

So, let's make a new symbol `name` .

```javascript
// third party library object
const thirdPartyLibraryObject = {
  name: "example",
};

// create a name Symbol
const name = Symbol("name");
```

- Here we created the `name` `Symbol` using the `Symbol()` factory function.
- Parameter `name` supplied to `Symbol()` factory function is optional, this is for debugging purposes and code readability other than that it doesn't do any good.
- A unique value is internally created by calling the `Symbol()` factory function.

Now Let's add the `name` symbol to `thirdPartyLibraryObject`.

```javascript
// third party library object
const thirdPartyLibraryObject = {
  name: "example",
};

// create a name Symbol
const name = Symbol("name");

// add name symbol to object
thirdPartyLibraryObject[name] = "example 2";
```

- To add value and attach the symbol we need to use the `[]` (bracket operator) followed by the value we want to add to the symbol like this.

```javascript
// add name symbol to object
thirdPartyLibraryObject[name] = "example 2";
```

## NOTE: Pass the reference of the symbol `name` and don't put the `name` variable inside quotes. If you put the name in quotes you would be overwriting the actual name property.

Now if you look into `thirdPartyLibraryObject`, you can see that there are 2 properties like this.

```javascript
{
    name: "example",
    Symbol(name): "example 2"
}
```

Okay. Now how do we access this unique symbol `name` from the object `thirdPartyLibraryObject`.

We can use the `[]` (bracket operator) to access the value of the Symbol `name` like this.

```javascript
// access the name symbol value
const symbolName = thirdPartyLibraryObject[name];
```

## NOTE: Pass the symbol reference inside the bracket operator and don't put it inside the quotes.

We will be discussing more about the `Symbol` datatype in the [next blog post](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/symbol-javascript-part-2). Well, this is a start 🤓.
