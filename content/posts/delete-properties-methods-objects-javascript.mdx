Properties and methods from an object can be deleted using the `delete` operator

---

We know that we can add properties and methods to an object using the `.` or the `[]` notation.

To delete, there are not any methods in the `Object()` constructor function.

We have to use the `delete` operator.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  bio: "I'm a human",
};
```

Let's now remove the `bio` property from `John` object.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  bio: "I'm a human",
};

// delete bio property
delete John.bio;

/*

Result:
--------

{
    name: "John Doe", 
    age: 23, 
}

*/
```

You have to write the `delete` keyword followed by the property you want to remove.

This applies to remove methods from an object.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  bio: "I'm a human",
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};

// delete sayHello function
delete John.sayHello;

/*

Result:
--------

{
    name: "John Doe", 
    age: 23, 
    bio: "I'm a human"
}


*/
```
