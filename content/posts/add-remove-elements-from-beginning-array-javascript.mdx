The `unshit` array method adds an element to the beginning of an array and the `shift` method removes the first element from an array.

## Adding elements to the beginning of the array

Consider this array of names.

```javascript
const names = ["John", "Lily", "Helen", "Roy"];
```

How can we add another name `Michael` to the beginning of this array?

We can use the `unshift` array method here to achieve this.

```javascript
const names = ["John", "Lily", "Helen", "Roy"];

// add elements to the beginning
const newLength = names.unshift("Michael"); // Result: ["Michael", "John", "Lily", "Helen", "Roy"]
```

- The `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array.
- It accepts the item to be added as the argument
- It returns the new length of an array

## Removing elements from the beginning of an array

Let's consider our old array with `Michael` added.

```javascript
const names = ["Michael", "John", "Lily", "Helen", "Roy"];
```

Now we no longer need `Michael` and want to remove it.

We could use the `shift` array method to acheive this.

```javascript
const names = ["Michael", "John", "Lily", "Helen", "Roy"];
const newArray = names.shift();
```

- The `shift` method removes the first element on an array.
- It didn't accept any arguments
- It returns the removed item
