To do operations and to ensure the application runs smoothly while performing operations on DOM, we have to wait till DOM or the whole HTML elements loads.

There are 2 types of load event we can listen on the DOM:

- `load` event on the `window` object
- `DOMContentLoaded` event on the `document` object

## The `load` event in the `window` object

The `load` event in the `window` object waits until the DOM is fully loaded like all the resources including the images, iframes, etc is loaded.

The `load` event is triggered after everything on a page is loaded.

To do that, Let's add an event listener to listen for the `load` event in the global `window` object.

```javascript
// listen for load event in the window
window.addEventListener("load", function () {
  // do things after the DOM loads fully
  console.log("Everything is loaded");
});
```

## The `DOMContentLoaded` event in the `document` object

The `DOMContentLoaded` event in the `document` object is a bit different from the `load` event as this event is triggered when the browser loads the HTML and the DOM is built. It won't wait for resources like images, iframes etc.to load.

To do that, Let's add an event listener to listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event in the `document` object.

```javascript
// listen for DOMContentLoaded event in teh document
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // do things after the DOM loads partially
  console.log("DOM is loaded");
});
```
