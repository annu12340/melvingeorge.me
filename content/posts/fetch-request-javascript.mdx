Most of the time if you have an application, there will be a need to get some data
from different sources like a server, API endpoint, etc.

Let's say you have an API endpoint `/blogs` from where you need to get all the blogs. The `fetch()` method available in JavaSript helps us to fetch data from this endpoint and it is very easy to do 🦄.

## `fetch()` method

Let's use a free API endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to get some blog data.

```javascript
// fetch blogs
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
```

We are just passing the endpoint to fetch the blog posts to the `fetch()` method.

But wait, we are requesting for data in the endpoint! How are going to get the data? 🤔

To get the data, we need to attach a `then()` method to the `fetch()` method, because fetch methods are asynchronous and only returns a [Promise](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/promises-javascript) if the request is successful or unsuccessful.

Inside the `then()` method we will provide a callback function to process the response or the blog data coming from the server.

Lets add the `then()` method.

```javascript
// fetch blogs
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts").then((response) => {
  /* We need to do some stuffs here */
});
```

When we get the response from the API endpoint we are getting something called a `Response` object which is of no use to us because we won't be able to work with that.

So We need to convert the `Response` object into something we can work with, like JSON or a text.

To convert into JSON, there is a method called `json()` available in the response object.

Let's convert the `Response` object into JSON.

```javascript
// fetch blogs
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts").then((response) => {
  // convert it to json and return the promise
  return response.json();
});
```

Since `json()` method also returns a promise lets return that promise and use another `then()` method to really work with the JSON.

```javascript
// fetch blogs
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then((response) => {
    // convert it to json and return the promise
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => {
    // do some fun things with the json we got
    // eg: show the blogs to the user
    console.log(json);
  });
```

Also, remember to add a `catch()` method at the end of the chain of `then()` methods to catch any errors for unsuccessful requests.

```javascript
// fetch blogs
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then((response) => {
    // convert it to json and return the promise
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => {
    // do some fun things with the json we got
    // eg: show the blogs to the user
    console.log(json);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // do error handling
    console.log(err);
  });
```

Yay 🤩. We got all the blogs.

Like `json()` you can also use:

- `text()`: for converting it to text
- `formData()`: getting an form data as an object
- `blob()`: converting to blob format

## Using fetch in Node.js Environment

As of writing this post, Node.js doesn't support the `fetch()` method out of the box.

So you may need to install a package called `node-fetch` to achieve this.

```bash
npm install node-fetch --save
```

Then you need to require it in the files where you need to use the `fetch()` method.

```javascript
// require node-fetch
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
```

Then you can do everything in Node.js just like we did in the browser.

This is just a starter on how to request data using `fetch()`, You can also send data using fetch. Let's discuss this in another blog post 😃.
