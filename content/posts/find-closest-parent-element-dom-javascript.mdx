Suppose you have an element and want to get a reference to the closest parent element up the DOM tree.

To achieve that you can use the `closest()` method on a specific element and pass the selector string. The method returns a reference to the first closest parent element matching the selector.

Consider this HTML,

```html
<section>
  <div class="article">
    <div class="heading-section">
      <h1 id="main-heading">This is a big heading</h1>
      <p id="sub-heading">A sub heading</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

Here we have an `h1` tag with `id="main-heading"` and we want to get a reference to the `div` tag with `class="article"`.

Let's write the code for that.

First, Let's get the reference to our `h1` tag.

```javascript
// reference to h1 tag
const h1 = document.querySelector("#main-heading");
```

Now let's use the `closest()` DOM element method and pass the selector string for the parent tag that is the `.article` class name as an argument to it.

```javascript
// reference to h1 tag
const h1 = document.querySelector("#main-heading");

// get reference to parent element
// with class name article
const article = h1.closest(".article");

console.dir(article); // article reference
```

- If there is no element with `.article` class name, the method returns null.
