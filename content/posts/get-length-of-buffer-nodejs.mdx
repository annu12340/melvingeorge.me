To get the length of a `Buffer` instance in Node.js, you can use the `length` property in the `Buffer` instance.

Let's say we have a buffer from the string `Hello World!` like this,

```javascript
// Buffer from string Hello World!
const buff = Buffer.from("Hello World!", "utf-8");
```

Now let's get its length using the property `length` in the `buff` object.

```javascript
// Buffer from string Hello World!
const buff = Buffer.from("Hello World!", "utf-8");

// get the length of the Buffer
const length = buff.length;

console.log(length); // 12
```

See this example live in [repl.it](https://repl.it/@melvin2016/length-of-buffer-nodejs).
