To get the string length in bytes in Node.js, you can use the `byteLength()` method in the `Buffer` class.

Let's say you have a string called `Hello World!`,

```javascript
// string
const str = "Hello World!";
```

Now let's use the `Buffer.byteLength()` to get the bytes of the string.

```javascript
// string
const str = "Hello World!";

// get string length in bytes
const bytes = Buffer.byteLength(str, "utf-8");

console.log(bytes); // 12
```

- The method accepts types of `Buffer`, `String`, etc as the first argument.
- The second argument is the encoding, the default is `utf-8`.
- The method returns the size of the bytes as an `integer`.

See this example live in [repl.it](https://repl.it/@melvin2016/string-length-as-bytes).
