To make an object read only or immutable you can use the `Object.freeze()` method.

---

Consider this object,

```javascript
const Car = {
  name: "Audi",
  year: "2020",
};
```

We don't want any more properties to be added to this `Car` object.

Let's use the `Object.freeze()` method to achieve this.

```javascript
const Car = {
  name: "Audi",
  year: "2020",
};

// make car object immutable
Object.freeze(Car);
```

Now if you try to add or change any properties in the `Car` object, it will throw an error in strict mode.

```javascript
const Car = {
  name: "Audi",
  year: "2020",
};

// make car object immutable
Object.freeze(Car);

// try to add a new property
Car.engineType = "BS-VI"; // error in strict mode
```

- The `Object.freeze()` method accepts the object to make it immutable as the parameter.
- The method returns the same object which is passed into it.
- Cannot add or modify any properties and methods after calling the method.
- It also restricts any modification to the prototype.
