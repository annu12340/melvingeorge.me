Let's say you have an object called `John`.

```javascript
const John = {};
```

Now we can add the `name` property and assign it a value of `John Doe` and also make it a not changing or immutable property.

We can acheive this through the `Object.defineProperty()` static method.

```javascript
const John = {};

// setting property name: "John Doe"
// and also making it immutable
Object.defineProperty(John, "name", {
  value: "John Doe",
  writable: false,
});
```

The method accepts:

- The object to add the property as the first parameter, in our case `John`.
- The name of the property you want to add to the object as the second parameter, in our case the `name` property.
- The third parameter is called descriptor where we are setting the `value` option to the value we want in our `name` property in our case "John Doe" and `writable` property to `false` for making it immutable.

Now if you try to change the value of the `name` in object `John`, It will throw an error in strict mode.

```javascript
// will throw an error
John.name = "Lily";
```

### There are many other options you can set in the descriptor including `writable`, `enumerable`, and `configurable`.

### Check more about these options in [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty)
