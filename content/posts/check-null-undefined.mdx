In many cases, we have `null` or `undefined` values in our variables. We can conditionally show other relevant value using the new `??` (Nullish coalescing) operator instead of just showing `null` or `undefined` values.

Consider these variables `name` with the value of `null` and `age` with the value of `23`.

```javascript
// name and age variables
let name = null;
let age = 23;
```

Now if we try to view the values using the console.log() method it would show `null` and `23` in the console.

```javascript
// name and age variables
let name = null;
let age = 23;

console.log(name, age);
```

But we don't want an unpredictable behavior like that.

Let's now remove that unpredictable behavior using the `??` operator.

```javascript
// name and age variables
let name = null;
let age = 23;

// using ?? operator
console.log(name ?? "Anonymous", age ?? "Age not defined");
```

Now if we try to view the variables we can see that when showing the `name` variable it shows `Anonymous` and for the `age` variable it shows the number 23.

This is what the `??` operator does.

### It checks if a variable has `null` or `undefined` values and if it does contain those values it doesn't take that value and gives it what comes after the `??` operator. In our case `Anonymous` value.

Now if you try to change the `age` value to `undefined`.

it will show,

```
Anonymous
Age not defined
```

### 🚨 NOTE: The `??` operator only checks if values are `null` or `undefined`. It doesn't check for boolean values `true`, `false` `1` or `0`. To check for boolean values you may need to use the `||` (`OR` operator) or `&&` (AND operator).

### ⚠️ NOTE: This operator is a new addition to JavaScript. You may need to use polyfills to work with older browsers.
