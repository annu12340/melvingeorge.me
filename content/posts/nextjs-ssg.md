The First thing that i would like to point out is that Next.js is a framework built for React.js which itself is another framework for building web applications, but don't get blowed up on the idea of learning another framework.

Because, Its more of like an engine instead of traditional frameworks.

☝🏻First thing being you dont have to learn anything you just need the concept of React.js.

✌️Secondly, You can use it as a:

- Static Site Generator (SSG)
- Server Side Renderer (SSR)
- Client Side Renderer (CSR)

Cool! Right?

## Static Site Generator - SSG

```jsx
import React from "react";

const CoolComponent = () => <div>I'm a cool component!!</div>;

export default CoolComponent;
```
