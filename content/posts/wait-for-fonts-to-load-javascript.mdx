Many times we may want to do some work after all our fonts are loaded on a webpage.

We can do this using the `document.fonts` object.

The object returns another object called `FontFaceSet` in which you can find the `ready` property.

- The `ready` in the `FontFaceSet` is a Promise.

- This promise is resolved only after the fonts in an HTML document is loaded.

Let's write the code to understand it better.

```javascript
document.fonts.ready
  .then(() => {
    // do those operations after
    // the fonts are loaded here
    console.log("Fonts are loaded!!!");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error");
  });
```

Here we have written a `then()` handler to do some operations when our fonts are loaded and a `catch()` handler when there is an error in loading fonts.
