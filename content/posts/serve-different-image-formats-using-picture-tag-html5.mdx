## Why do we need to serve different image formats?

Since the introduction of `WebP` image format by Google, many of the sites are converting to use WebP format to increase performance, Since `JPEG` images are larger than `WebP` and the loading times are horrible for `JPEG` images.

But still, WebP is not supported by many of the browsers and we want to show the `JPEG` if the `WebP` image is not supported.

`WebP` Provides lossless and lossy compression to images.

To know more about the performance of WebP image format, you can check out the blog [WebP Images & Performance on davidwalsh.name](https://davidwalsh.name/webp-images-performance).

## How to use this?

To serve different image formats, you use the `<picture>` HTML tag and provide different sources using the `<source>` tag. The source tag acts like fallbacks. Let's look at how it's done.

Let's say I have one image, one in `jpeg` format and one in `webp` format.

Our goal is to show the `webp` image if it is supported and if it's not supported by the browser then it should show the `jpeg` image.

First let's write the `picture` tag like this,

```html
<picture>
  <!-- Picture Tag -->
</picture>
```

After that you need to make a `source` tag and with `srcset` and `type` attribute like this,

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="" type="" />
</picture>
```

You need to pass the source of the `webp` image in the `srcset` attribute and the type of the image i.e `image/webp` like this.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="myImage.webp" type="image/webp" />
</picture>
```

Let's also provide the `jpeg` format if the browser doesn't support the `webp` format.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="myImage.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="myImage.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" />
</picture>
```

It's actually done, But what if the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` tag itself so let's add an `img` tag inside the `picture` tag so that the image is guaranteed to show in every browser. 😃

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="myImage.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="myImage.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" />
  <img src="myImage.jpeg" alt="A JPEG Image" />
</picture>
```

That's all! 🌟.

To understand it better I have made this [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/henoyuposu/1/edit?html,output).

If you view this link in the Chrome browser it will show an image of a House (WebP Image) and if you view it in the Safari browser (Not supports WebP image format yet!) it will show an Image of a Squirrel (JPEG Image).
