Let's say you have an object called `John`.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  salary: 23000,
};
```

We can check whether the property `salary` property is present in the object using the `hasOwnProperty()` method available in the prototype chain of the `John` object.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  salary: 23000,
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};

// check if the salary is present in John
John.hasOwnProperty("salary");
```

- The method returns `true` if present and `false` if not.
- Available in the prototype chain of an object.

You can also check if a method is present in the object.

Now let's check if `sayHello` method is present.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  salary: 23000,
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};

// check if the salary is present in John
John.hasOwnProperty("salary"); // Result: true

// check if sayHello function is present in John
John.hasOwnProperty("sayHello"); // Result: true
```
