## `alert()` method

The `alert()` method is used to show some quick alerts like warnings, errors, or information.

```javascript
alert("This is a warning! 🚫"); // alert shown
```

The method accepts a string as the argument to be shown to the user.

The alert will open as a modal like this.

## `prompt()` method

The `prompt()` method is used to take input from the user.

```javascript
// get age using prompt method
const age = prompt("What is your age", 18);

console.log(age);
```

The method accepts a string as the first argument which is shown to the user and a placeholder value as the second argument.

The method returns the value user entered if OK is pressed and `null` if cancel, is pressed.

## `confirm()` method

The `confirm()` method is used to ask the user about a condition. eg: `Do you want to continue?`.

```javascript
// ask user a condition
const continue = confirm("Do you want to continue?");

console.log(continue);
```

The method accepts a string as a parameter to be shown to the user.

If the user pressed `OK` the method will return boolean `true` and `false` if not.
