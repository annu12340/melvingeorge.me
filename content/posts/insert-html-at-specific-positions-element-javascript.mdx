To insert HTML at different positions in an element, you can use the `insertAdjacentHTML()` DOM element method in JavaScript.

The `insertAdjacentHTML()` DOM element method accepts 2 arguments:

- The position to insert the HTML as the first argument. You can insert the HTML at different positions and these positions are:

  - `beforebegin`: inserts the HTML before the beginning of the element
  - `afterbegin`: inserts the HTML after the beginning of the element, i.e as the first child of the element.
  - `beforeend`: inserts the HTML just before the element ends, i.e as the last child of the element
  - `afterend`: inserts the HTML after the element

- The HTML to insert as the second argument.

Consider this HTML with a `nav` tag with 2 `anchor` tag inside it,

```html
<nav>
  <a>Home</a>
  <a>Blogs</a>
</nav>
```

Let's look at the different positions we mentioned one by one.

### `beforebegin` position

We can insert a `h1` tag just before the `nav` tag using the `insertAdjacentHTML()` method and passing the postion `beforebegin` as the first argument and the HTML as the second argument like this,

```js
// get reference to the nav tag
const nav = document.querySelector("nav");

// insert heading tag
// just before the nav tag
nav.insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", "<h1>This is a Heading</h1>");
```

So now the HTML looks like this,

```html
<!-- This is the new Heading tag -->
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<nav>
  <a>Home</a>
  <a>Blogs</a>
</nav>
```

### `afterbegin` position

We insert an `anchor` tag just after the `nav` tag using the `insertAdjacentHTML()` method and passing the postion `afterbegin` as the first argument and the HTML as the second argument like this,

```js
// get reference to the nav tag
const nav = document.querySelector("nav");

// insert anchor tag
// just after the nav tag
nav.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", "<a>Dashboard</a>");
```

So now the HTML looks like this,

```html
<!-- This is the new Heading tag -->
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<nav>
  <!-- This is the new Anchor tag as the first child -->
  <a>Dashboard</a>

  <a>Home</a>
  <a>Blogs</a>
</nav>
```

### `beforeend` position

We insert an `anchor` tag just before the `nav` tag ends using the `insertAdjacentHTML()` method and passing the postion `beforeend` as the first argument and the HTML as the second argument like this,

```js
// get reference to the nav tag
const nav = document.querySelector("nav");

// insert anchor tag
// just before the nav tag ends
nav.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", "<a>Logout</a>");
```

So now the HTML looks like this,

```html
<!-- This is the new Heading tag -->
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<nav>
  <!-- This is the new Anchor tag as the first child -->
  <a>Dashboard</a>

  <a>Home</a>
  <a>Blogs</a>

  <a>Logout</a>
  <!-- This is the new Anchor tag as the last child child -->
</nav>
```

### `afterend` position

We insert a `paragraph` tag just after the `nav` tag using the `insertAdjacentHTML()` method and passing the postion `afterend` as the first argument and the HTML as the second argument like this,

```js
// get reference to the nav tag
const nav = document.querySelector("nav");

// insert paragraph tag
// after the nav tag
nav.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<p>This is a paragraph</p>");
```

So now the HTML looks like this,

```html
<!-- This is the new Heading tag -->
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<nav>
  <!-- This is the new Anchor tag as the first child -->
  <a>Dashboard</a>

  <a>Home</a>
  <a>Blogs</a>

  <a>Logout</a>
  <!-- This is the new Anchor tag as the last child child -->
</nav>

<!-- This is the new Paragraph tag -->
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```
