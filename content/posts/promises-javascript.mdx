## What is a Promise?

Promises in JavaScript is a way of working with asynchronous processes. Promises don't block other processes and run in the JavaScript's `Event loop`.

## Create a new Promise

To create a `Promise` you have to create a `Promise` object.

```javascript
// Create a new promise
const promise = new Promise();
```

You need to pass a function with 2 parameters to resolve the task and to reject the task to the constructor function.

Now, Let's create the function to run.

```javascript
// Create a function to run.
// Let's simulate getting a result
// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function

const giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {
  // You can also do a fetch request
  // from a server to get some data.

  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("We got the data :) ");
  }, 3000);
};
```

A lot is going on these lines 🤯 Let's understand each step by step. 🧙‍♀️

Here we have a function called `giveResultAfterThreeSeconds` with 2 parameters called `resolve` and `reject`.
Both these parameters are references to function which can be invoked while running the task.

The `resolve` function is invoked when we got the desired result and the `reject` function is invoked whenever there is an error while running the task.

In the body of the function, we have a `setTimeout` function to simulate waiting for 3 seconds.

After 3 seconds the `resolve` function is called with a value of `We got the data :)`.

We would also be expecting some kind of error happening in the future while running our task, thus we need the `reject` function to invoke it with an error value.

Here we are not using the `reject` function since we don't have the possibility of `setTimeout` function failing.

The `reject` function can be used when getting some data from a server where we have the possibility of getting an error eg: Internal Server Error, Not Found, etc.

Now let's give this function to our promise.

```javascript
// Create a function to run.
// Let's simulate getting a result
// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function

const giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {
  // You can also do a fetch request
  // from a server to get some data.

  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("We got the data :)");
  }, 3000);
};

// Create a new promise and pass the function
const promise = new Promise(giveResultAfterThreeSeconds);
```

So we defined our function and made a promise. But how do we use it?

To use it we can use the `then`, `catch` methods available in our `promise` object.

```javascript
// Create a function to run.
// Let's simulate getting a result
// after 3 seconds using the setTimeout function

const giveResultAfterThreeSeconds = (resolve, reject) => {
  // You can also do a fetch request
  // from a server to get some data.

  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("We got the data :)");
  }, 3000);
};

// Create a new promise and pass the function
const promise = new Promise(giveResultAfterThreeSeconds);

// then and catch
promise
  .then(
    (resolvedValue) => {
      console.log(resolvedValue); //  Result ==> We got the data :)
    },
    (rejectedValue) => {
      console.log(rejectedValue); // will be invoked if there is a rejected value
    }
  ) //
  .catch((rejectedValue) => console.log(errorValue)); // will be invoked if there is a rejected value
```

- The `then` method is used to get a resolved value as well a rejected value, It accepts 2 callbacks The first callback function refers to the resolved value's callback function and the second refers to the rejected value's if there is one. The `then` method can also be chained.

- The `catch` method is used to receive a rejected value. It accepts a callback function for rejected value and the function is supplied with a value from the `reject` function.

We will be discussing more about `Promises` in future Posts. Well, Its a start.
