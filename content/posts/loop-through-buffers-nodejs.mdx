To loop through a `Buffer` instance we can use the `entries()` method available in the buffer instance with the `for...of` looping statement.

Let's say we have a Buffer instance with String `Hello World!` like his,

```javascript
// Buffer instance with string Hello World!
const buff = Buffer.from("Hello World!");
```

Now to loop through the Buffer let's use the `entries()` method and the `for...of` looping statement like this,

```javascript
// Buffer instance with string Hello World!
const buff = Buffer.from("Hello World!");

// loop through buffer instance
for (let pair of buff.entries()) {
  console.log(pair);
}
```

- The `entries()` method returns the data in `[index, byte]` format.

The output of the above code looks like this.

```js
/*

[ 0, 72 ]
[ 1, 101 ]
[ 2, 108 ]
[ 3, 108 ]
[ 4, 111 ]
[ 5, 32 ]
[ 6, 87 ]
[ 7, 111 ]
[ 8, 114 ]
[ 9, 108 ]
[ 10, 100 ]
[ 11, 33 ]

*/
```

But if you don't want this in the `[index, byte]` format but as a single string, you can use the `String.fromCharCode()` method to get the appropriate character inside the loop like this,

```javascript
// Buffer instance with string Hello World!
const buff = Buffer.from("Hello World!");

// loop through buffer instance
for (let pair of buff.entries()) {
  // get the byte of character
  const charCode = pair[1];
  // use String.fromCharCode() to get the appropriate character
  // for the byte
  console.log(String.fromCharCode(charCode));
}
```

The output of the above code looks like this,

```js
/*

H
e
l
l
o

W
o
r
l
d
!

*/
```
