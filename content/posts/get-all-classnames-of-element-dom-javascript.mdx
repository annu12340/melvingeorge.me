To get all the class names present in a DOM element, you can use the `classList` property on the corresponding element using JavaScript.

Let's say you have an `h1` element tag with class names `text-red` and `rounded-border` like this,

PS: I'm not writing the CSS for `text-red` and `rounded-border` classes since it is not needed to understand this property.

element.classList

```html
<h1 class="text-red rounded-border">Heading</h1>
```

Now let's get theses class names in JavaScript using the `classList` property like this,

```javascript
// first get the reference to the h1 tag
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

// using classList property
const h1ClassNames = h1.classList;

console.log(h1ClassNames);
```

- The `classList` property returns the class names as `DOMTokenList` array-like object.
- You can get each class names from the object using the index as they are appearing in the element. For example, to get the first class name in the `h1` element, you can use `h1ClassNames[0]`.
- The `DOMTokenList` object is iterable so that you can use any valid looping construct in JavaScript.

See live example on [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/wojetatiwi/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output).
