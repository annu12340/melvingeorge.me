To stop or abort a fetch request, you have to use the `AbortController` API. This helps to stop the fetch request from the client-side only but not on the server-side. The server continues to process the request even after the request is stopped from the client-side.

Let's see this in action.

First, we need to create an object of `AbortController`.

```javascript
// create an object of AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();
```

Then we need to get the `signal` property from the controller object and pass it as an option to the fetch request as an option.

```javascript
// create an object of AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();

// get the signal property from the controller
const signal = controller.signal;
```

Pass the `signal` property as an option to the fetch request.

### The `signal` property is a Read-only property.

Let's use an API endpoint from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) website for the fetch request.

```javascript
// create an object of AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();

// get the signal property from the controller
const signal = controller.signal;

// fetch request
// passing signal as an option
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", { signal })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json));
```

We have now configured the fetch request to use the `AbortController`.

Now to stop the ongoing fetch request we have to use the `abort()` method in the `controller` object.

```javascript
// To stop the ongoing fetch request
controller.abort();
```
