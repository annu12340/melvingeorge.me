## WARNING 🤯: This is a new method and may not work in some browsers as of now.

To get attribute values from HTML elements to css, you can use the `attr()` CSS function.

Consider this html, where you have a `h1` tag with class name `heading`.

```html
<h1 class="heading">Hello World!</h1>
```

Now Let's style this `h1` tag with some CSS.

```css
.heading {
  background-color: black;
  color: red;
}
```

Now you may ask what's cool about this? This is just normal stuff. 🧐

What if we need to give custom background colors and text colors whenever we make another `h1` tag?

This is not possible because we have already hard coded the styles in CSS.

But not anymore!! That is why we have `attr()` CSS function.

_The `attr()` function helps us to get values from attributes of HTML elements._

Now let's rewrite our html and add custom properties called `data-bgcolor` and `data-textcolor` in the `h1` tag.

```html
<h1 class="heading" data-bgcolor="black" data-textcolor="red">Hello World!</h1>
```

Now lets use the `attr()` function in CSS to the values of the custom attributes in CSS.

```css
.heading {
  background-color: attr(data-bgcolor color);
  color: attr(data-textcolor color);
}
```

- Here we are getting the values of both the `data-bgcolor` and `data-textcolor` custom attributes from the `h1` tag to the CSS.

- The `attr()` function accepts the name of the custom attribute or native attribute name followed by a space and the unit for example,
  - for strings - `string`
  - for any kind of colors - `color`
  - for numbers - `number`

In our case, we have given the unit as `color` since we want to change the `background-color` property and `color` property.
