## Create buffer space

To create buffer space we can use the `alloc()` method in the global `Buffer` class in Node.js.

- The method takes the number of bytes (`integer`) to allocate as the first argument.
- The method returns a buffer object.

Let's allocate a buffer space of 10 bytes.

```javascript
// allocate 10 bytes of buffer space
const buff = Buffer.alloc(10);

// display buff contents
console.log(buff); // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
```

To initialize the bytes with other than 0, you can pass that integer or string as the second argument like this,

```javascript
// allocate 10 bytes of buffer space
// allocate with integer 1
const buff = Buffer.alloc(10, 1);

// display buff contents
console.log(buff); // <Buffer 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01>
```

## Write to Buffer

To write to a buffer space we can use the `write()` method in the `Buffer` object.

- The method accepts a string as the first argument to write.

```javascript
// allocate 10 bytes of buffer space
const buff = Buffer.alloc(10);

// write to buffer
const bytesWrote = buff.write("John Doe");

console.log(bytesWrote); // 8
console.log(buff); // Raw Buffer: <Buffer 4a 6f 68 6e 20 44 6f 65 00 00>
console.log(buff.toString()); // String: John Doe
```

### We can use the `toString()` method in the `buff` object to convert a raw buffer to string.

We can also define the starting point where it needs to write to the buffer.

For example, if we want to write to buffer after 2 bytes we can pass that as the second argument to the `write()` method.

```javascript
// allocate 10 bytes of buffer space
const buff = Buffer.alloc(10);

// write to buffer
// after 2 bytes
const bytesWrote = buff.write("John Doe", 2);

console.log(bytesWrote); // 8
console.log(buff); // Raw Buffer: <Buffer 00 00 4a 6f 68 6e 20 44 6f 65>
console.log(buff.toString()); // String: John Doe
```

If you look closely into the contents inside the `buff` variable you can see that the first 2 bytes are `00 00` which means we started writing into the buffer after 2 bytes.
