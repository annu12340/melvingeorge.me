To write to a `WritableStream`, we can use the `write()` method available in the `WritableStream` object as the data comes in from the `ReadableStream` as we discussed in the [last blog post](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/create-write-stream-node).

This is so common that the Node.js provides a simple way of doing this using the `pipe()` method in the `ReadableStream` object.

Let's look at it now.

Suppose we have a Read stream where we want to read some data from and a write stream to write the read data like this,

```javascript
// require the filesystem module
const fs = require("fs");

// create a read stream to read data
// from hello.txt file
const rs = fs.createReadStream("./hello.txt");

// create a write stream to write the
// read data to toWrite.txt file
const ws = fs.createWriteStream("./toWrite.txt");
```

Now instead of listening on the `data` event and then using the `write()` method to write the data, we can use the `pipe()` method in `ReadableStream` object `rs` like this,

```javascript
// require the filesystem module
const fs = require("fs");

// create a read stream to read data
// from hello.txt file
const rs = fs.createReadStream("./hello.txt");

// create a write stream to write the
// read data to toWrite.txt file
const ws = fs.createWriteStream("./toWrite.txt");

// write to the ws WritableStream
// using the pipe() method
rs.pipe(ws);
```

- The `pipe()` method is only available in a `ReadableStream` and not in `WritableStream`.
- The method accepts a valid `WritableStream` object as its parameter.

Now, You can see that the data of the `hello.txt` file is written to the `toWrite.txt` file.
