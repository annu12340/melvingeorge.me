Suppose we are in a webpage with the URL of `https://dummywebsite.com/blog?page=1`.

## To get full URL

To get the full URL of the current webpage programmatically in Javascript, you can use the `URL` property available in the `document` object.

```javascript
// get full url
const fullURL = document.URL;

console.log(fullURL); // https://dummywebsite.com/blog?page=1
```

## To get only the origin URL

To get only the origin URL i.e, the main URL.

you can use the `location.origin` property in the `document` object.

```javascript
// get only origin url
const origin = document.location.origin;

console.log(origin); // https://dummywebsite.com
```

## To get the pathname

To get the pathname of URL i.e, url coming after the main URL.

You can use the `location.pathname` property in the `document` object.

```javascript
// get pathname of url
const pathname = document.location.pathname;

console.log(pathname); // /blog
```

## To get the query used in URL

To get the query term used in the URL, you can use the `location.search` in the `document` object.

```javascript
// get query term
const query = document.location.search;

console.log(query); // ?page=1
```

If no query, it will return `""`, a blank string.

## To get the protocol used in the URL

You can use the `location.protocol` in the `document` object.

```javascript
// get the protocol used
const protocol = document.location.protocol;

console.log(protocol); // https:
```
