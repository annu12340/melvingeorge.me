The yield keyword in the generator function is commonly used to return a value from the generator function.

But what if I told you it can do more than that!

It can also accept a value to a generator function.

Let's understand this,

let's make a generator function that asks a question first and then takes a value and then yields a value based on that.

```javascript
// Multiply by 2 Generator function
function* MultiplyBy2() {
  const number = yield "Which number would you like to be multiplied by 2 with?";

  yield number * 2;
}

// initializing genrator function
const multiplyBy2 = MultiplyBy2();

// First the question is returned from generator function
// We can show the returned or yielded value using the
// next() method and then using the value property
console.log(multiplyBy2.next().value); // the question is shown
```

- Here we have a generator function which first gives a question `Which number would you like to be multiplied by 2 with?` to the user.

- After initializing the generator function, then we are showing the first yield value which is the question to the user using the `next()` method and access the value using the `value` property.

- **Now to pass a value to the generator function we need to pass that value as an argument to the `next()` method like this**.

```javascript
// Multiply by 2 Generator function
function* MultiplyBy2() {
  const number = yield "Which number would you like to be multiplied by 2 with?";

  yield number * 2;
}

// initialising generator function
const multiplyBy2 = MultiplyBy2();

// First the question is returned from generator function
// We can show the returned or yielded value using the
// next() method and then using the value property
console.log(multiplyBy2.next().value); // the question is shown

// passing 4 as a value to the generator function
// as an argument to the next() method
// after that, the passed value is multiplied by 2
// and then the next yield value is
// returned from the generator function
console.log(multiplyBy2.next(4).value);
```

- **Now the passed value will be stored inside the `number` variable inside the generator function, and the next value of the yield is returned from the generator function (The value which is multiplied by 2)**
