I have always loved open source since I started learning web development. Every one of us uses open source products, libraries directly or indirectly and even big companies rely on it for their huge successes.

JavaScript language itself is known for introducing an explosion in several open-source libraries.

I started contributing to open source projects 2 years back and from there I haven't stopped contributing to open source.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the platforms where huge open-source projects and discussions are conducted. There are many other platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) etc.

## How can I start contributing to Open source?

Well, if you know Github and working with Git technologies, It's easy to get started.

If you like a library you are using to build projects in your daily life. Try contributing to that library since you already have some familiarity with the library.

For example, If you love React.js ( Framework for creating web application), Go to their [Github project](https://github.com/facebook/react) and look for bugs in issues section or if you have a new idea you can even make a pull request to discuss your concept. No need to shy away from asking questions. Every open source communities are welcoming and friendly 🤓.

For everybody those who are getting started. There will be issues listed as a `good first issue` or `good first contribution`.

Mozilla has been encouraging open source activities for a long time, they even have one website called [Codetribute](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/) to help beginners get started with open source contribution. I use this website most of the time.

There another one called [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and a lot more sites.
