To pass data between different browsing contexts like passing data between 2 open tabs, passing data between a tab and service worker, or any context of the **same origin** in JavaScript, you can use the `BroadcastChannel` API.

First, you have to make an instance of `BroadcastChannel` with the channel name of your choice.

The channel name should be passed as an argument to the `BroadcastChannel()` as a string.

```javascript
// create an instance of BroadcastChannel
// with channel name as test_channel
const channel = new BroadcastChannel("test_channel");
```

After creating an instance you need to add a `message` event listener to the `channel` object so that when you receive messages the callback function inside the event handler is called.

```javascript
// create an instance of BroadcastChannel
const channel = new BroadcastChannel("test_channel");

// add message event listener to receive meesage
channel.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // data property
  console.log(event.data);
});
```

The callback function is passed with an `event` object.

You can find the data inside the `data` property inside the event object.

Now you may think how will I send data?

For that you have to use the `postMessage()` method in the `channel` object.

```javascript
// create an instance of BroadcastChannel
const channel = new BroadcastChannel("test_channel");

// add message event listener to receive meesage
channel.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // data
  console.log(event.data);
});

// send some data or message
channel.postMessage({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
});
```

Now to test this open a new tab of the website and when you open you can see that the data `{ name: "John Doe", age: 23 }` is shown in the console.

For testing, you can head on to this **[JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/pemoquvoqo/2/edit?js,console)** and open a new tab of the same **JS BIN** URL to see the result.
