To get all the images present in the document or HTML, you can use the read-only property called `images` in the `document` object.

Let's say you have a HTML document with 3 image tags like this,

```html
<body>
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder image" />
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="Placeholder image" />
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250" alt="Placeholder image" />
</body>
```

Now let's get all the images in the HTML using the `document.images` property in JavaScript.

```javascript
// get all the images from HTML document
const images = document.images;
```

The references to the images are returned as an `HTMLcollection`.

```javascript
// get all the images from HTML document
const images = document.images;

console.dir(images);
```

To see working example see [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/tuzojuqisi/edit?html,js,console,output).
