To inherit properties and methods from one class to another we need to use the `extends` keyword.

Let's consider 2 classes, a base class `User` and a class `Admin` which inherits properties and methods from the `User` class.

You may ask why are we inheriting from `User` to `Admin` and not `Admin` to `User` because every admin is a user at the end and every admin should have every base functionalities of a user.

This is how you should logically map objects in any programming language.

```javascript
// base class
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    // properties
    this.name = name;
    this.category = "User";
  }

  // method
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// inheriting class
class Admin {
  // shutdownSystem() should be implemented in Admin class
  // because only admin should have the ability to turn off
  // a system in an organization
  shutdownSystem() {
    console.log("Shutting down the system");
  }
}
```

Now we have defined a base class and an inheriting class, But currently, we are not telling to get all the properties and methods from the `User` class to `Admin` class. For that, we need to use the `extends` keyword followed by the name of the class we want to inherit the properties and methods from the base class like this,

```javascript
// base class
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    // properties
    this.name = name;
    this.category = "User";
  }

  // method
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// inheriting class
// using extends keyword
class Admin extends User {
  // shutdownSystem() should be implemented in Admin class
  // because only admin should have the ability to turn off
  // a system in an organization
  shutdownSystem() {
    console.log("Shutting down the system");
  }
}
```

Now we have successfully inherited all the properties and methods from `User` to the `Admin` class.

Now let's create an object of `Admin` class.

```javascript
// base class
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    // properties
    this.name = name;
    this.category = "User";
  }

  // method
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// inheriting class
// using extends keyword
class Admin extends User {}
  // shutdownSystem() should be implemented in Admin class
  // because only admin should have the ability to turn off
  // a system in an organization
  shutdownSystem() {
    console.log("Shutting down the system");
  }
}

// create an object of Admin class
const John = new Admin("John Doe");
```

Yay! But wait? How can we pass the `"John Doe"` as an argument to the `Admin` class when we need to pass it to the `User` class.

Yes! That's the power of `extends` keyword the arguments are passed automatically to the base class on the order you have defined the parameters in the base class.

But if you have a constructor method in the `Admin` class itself the arguments are passed to the constructor method of `Admin` class and not to the `User` base class constructor method and you need to call the `super()` method which passes the arguments to the base class otherwise it will throw an error.

```javascript
// base class
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    // properties
    this.name = name;
    this.category = "User";
  }

  // method
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// inheriting class
// using extends keyword
class Admin extends User {
  // constructor method
  constructor(name, age) {
    // mandatory to pass arguments to the base class
    super(name);
    this.age = age;
  }

  // shutdownSystem() should be implemented in Admin class
  // because only admin should have the ability to turn off
  // a system in an organization
  shutdownSystem() {
    console.log("Shutting down the system");
  }
}

// create an object of Admin class
const John = new Admin("John Doe", 23);

// view the contents of John object
console.log(John);
```

```
// OUTPUT

{
  age: 23,
  category: "User",
  name: "John Doe"
}
```
