The `calc()` function is used to dynamically calculate CSS property values.

You can pass any valid CSS units as arguments to the `calc()` function.

For example, you can use an expression to substract `50px - 20px`.

```css
h1 {
  margin: calc(50px - 20px); // the value calculated will be 30px
}
```

You can use any valid CSS property values like `px`, `percentage`, `number`, `em`, `vw`, `rem`, etc.

One of the best usecases i have found with the `calc()` css function is to center the container element like this,

```css
// centering the container
.container {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

The width of the container is calculated to the full width of the viewing device and then `50px` is subtracted from `100%`.
