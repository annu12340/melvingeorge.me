Properties and methods can be copied from one object to another object using the `Object.assign()` method.

---

Let's say you have 2 objects `obj1` and `obj2`.

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Object 1" };

const obj2 = { bio: "This is my bio" };
```

We can copy the properties and methods from `obj2` to `obj1` using the `Object.assign()` method.

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Object 1" };

const obj2 = { bio: "This is my bio" };

// Copy from obj2 to obj1
Object.assign(obj1, obj2);

/*

obj1 - Result:
--------------

{
    name: "Object 1",
    bio: "This is my bio"
}

*/
```

- The method takes 2 parameters.
- The first parameter is the target object.
- The second parameter is the source object in which you want the contents to be copied.
- The method returns the target object.

### If the target object has the same property name as the source object it will be overridden.

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Object 1", age: 23 };

const obj2 = { bio: "This is my bio", age: 34 };

// Copy from obj2 to obj1
Object.assign(obj1, obj2);

/*

obj1 - Result:
--------------

{
    name: "Object 1", 
    age: 34, 
    bio: "This is my bio"
}

*/
```

The property `age: 23` in `obj1` is overridden by the property `age: 34` in `obj2`.

### Feel free to share if you found this useful 😃.
