When you build a web application, often we might need to save data for a user across visits to the website in the future.

You can achieve this functionality with the help of `localStorage` Browser API.

`localStorage` is a Web API for storing data. We can store data into it in a key/pair format.

## Storing Data

To store data we need to use the `setItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.

Let's store our user's names.

```javascript
const name = "John Doe";

// storing user's name
localStorage.setItem("name", name);
```

The method accepts:

- the name of the key as the first argument
- the value to store as the second argument

## Get Stored Data

To get the stored data we need to use the `getItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.

Let's retrieve the stored user's name

```javascript
// get stored name
const name = localStorage.getItem("name");
```

The method accepts:

- the name of the key as an argument.
- the method returns the stored value for the key name supplied

## Removing Stored Data

To remove stored data we need to use the `removeItem()` method available in the `localStorage` object.

Let's remove the stored user's name

```javascript
// remove the stored user's name
localStorage.removeItem("name");
```

The method accepts:

- the key name to remove as an argument.
