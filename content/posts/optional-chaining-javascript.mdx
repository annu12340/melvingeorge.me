Optional chaining operator (?.) is a new addition in JavaScript where it helps to checks if a property, method etc is present or not.

Let's look at an example to get to know more.

Let's create an object called `John` with the properties `name` and `age`.

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};
```

Now, what if we tried to access a property called `address` which is not in the `John` object. Yeah, you're right it will show `undefined`.

But that's OK-ish? Because at least this can be checked with an if statement like this.

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// this checking is ok for now
if (John.address) {
  console.log(John.address);
} else {
  console.log("Address property is not defined");
}
```

But oftentimes programmers in JavaScript tend to access more properties inside the `address` property and this makes things worse 😟. Because now JavaScript will throw a huge error instead of `Address property is not defined`.

Let's try to access another property called `street` inside the `address` property.

Try executing this code now,

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// this will throw an error 🚫
// since the address property is not defined
// and we are tring to access another property of street
// inside the address property which itself is undefined 🚨
if (John.address.street) {
  console.log(John.address.street);
} else {
  console.log("Address property is not defined");
}
```

That's where the use of the newly introduced `?.` optional chaining operator comes in.

The `?.` operator will check if the property is present and returns property if present and returns `undefined` if it is not present.

The `?.` operator is added after a property name that we want to check for.

eg: `John.address?.street`

Let's look at it now,

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// the ?. operator will check for the presence of property
// here, the  else statement will be executed
// instead of throwing an error
if (John.address?.street) {
  console.log(John.address.street);
} else {
  console.log("Address property is not defined");
}
```

Before optional chaining operator programmers used to do this kind of checks with the `&&` (AND) operator like this.

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// using AND operator
// instead of ?. operator
if (John && John.address && John.address.street) {
  console.log(John.address.street);
} else {
  console.log("Address property is not defined");
}
```

The `?.` operator can also be used to check for methods present in an object.

Suppose you are trying to call a method called `sayHello` which is not defined in the `John` object.

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// call sayHello() method
// which is not defined
John.sayHello();
```

It will throw an error saying `TypeError: John.sayHello is not a function`.

Let's check it with `?.` operator.

```javascript
// John object
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

// call sayHello() method
// but now checking with ?. operator
// and the method is not called ✅
John.sayHello?.();
```
