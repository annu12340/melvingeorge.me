To compare 2 buffers in Node.js, we can use the `compare()` method in the buffer object.

Let's say we have a buffer object like this,

```javascript
// buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.from("EFG");
```

and another buffer like this,

```javascript
// buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.from("EFG");

// buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.from("HIJ");
```

Now let's use the `compare()` in the `buff1` Buffer object to compare our `buff2` Buffer object like this,

```javascript
// buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.from("EFG");

// buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.from("HIJ");

// comparing 2 buffers
const value = buff1.compare(buff2);

console.log(value); // -1
```

- The method will return `-1` if it finds that the buffer object which is passed as a parameter into the `compare()` method is coming after the string `EFG` in the first buffer.
- The method will return `0` if it is the same.
- The method will return `1` if it finds that the buffer object which is passed as a parameter into the `compare()` method is coming before the string `EFG` in the first buffer.

Let's do another example to clearly understand it better

Let's make 2 buffers,

```javascript
// buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.from("KLM");

// buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.from("ABC");

// comparing 2 buffers
const value = buff1.compare(buff2);

console.log(value); // 1
```

If you look closely here we have the two buffers and in the first buffer we have string `KLM` and the second string `ABC`, we know that the string `ABC` is coming before the string `KLM`, so the `compare()` method will return `1`.

The method will return `0` if the string are same like this,

```javascript
// buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.from("ABC");

// buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.from("ABC");

// comparing 2 buffers
const value = buff1.compare(buff2);

console.log(value); // 0
```
