Static methods are those methods which are directly attached to a class or a constructor function rather than being a method on an object.

Static methods are common to every object since they are attached directly to a class or constructor function

Let's understand,

```javascript
// create a class
class User {
  constructor() {
    // property name
    this.name = "User";
  }

  // method sayHello()
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hey, I'm a user");
  }
}
```

Here we have created a class `User` with a property `name` and a method `sayHello()`.

We haven't created a static method yet.

To create a static method we have to use the `static` method in class syntax.

```javascript
// create a class
class User {
  constructor() {
    // property name
    this.name = "User";
  }
  // static method
  static iStandAlone() {
    console.log("I can be called without creating an instance of a class");
  }

  // method sayHello()
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hey, I'm a user");
  }
}
```

Since static methods are directly attached to a class and not on the instances of a class, we can call the static methods without making an instance of a class ( or object of a class).

You can static methods by using the class name followed by a dot `.` and static method name like this `User.iStandAlone()`

```javascript
// create a class
class User {
  constructor() {
    // property name
    this.name = "User";
  }
  // static method
  static iStandAlone() {
    console.log(
      "I can be called without creating an instance or object of a class"
    );
  }

  // method sayHello()
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hey, I'm a user");
  }
}

// iStandAlone() method can be called
// without craeting an instance or object of a class
User.iStandAlone();
```

In constructor function, static methods are made by attaching a function directly to it like this,

```javascript
// constructor function
const User = function () {
  // property name
  this.name = "User";
};

// method sayHello()
// attached to prototype chain
User.prototype.sayHello = () => {
  console.log("Hey, I'm a user");
};

// attach iStandAlone() method
// directly to constructor function
// not on prototype chain
User.iStandAlone = function () {
  console.log(
    "I can be called without creating an instance or object of a class"
  );
};

User.iStandAlone();
```

Now you may ask why do we even need static methods in a class.

The answer to that is if you want to create utility functions for objects or instances you make out of a class, declaring those methods as static methods is a good object-oriented approach.
