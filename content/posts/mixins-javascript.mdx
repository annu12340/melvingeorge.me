Mixins are those functions that cannot be used independently but when used with any class provide useful functionalities.

Consider this class `User`,

```javascript
// class User
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}
```

Here we have a class `User` with the property `name` and a method that returns the property `name`.

Let's now make an object with methods `sayGreeting()` and `sayGoodBye()` which greets a user by name and says goodbye to a user respectively.

```javascript
const greetAndBye = {
  // greeting method
  sayGreeting() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  },

  // goodbye method
  sayGoodBye() {
    return `Goodbye, ${this.name}`;
  },
};
```

As you can see, if we try to call the methods independently the methods are not useful at all.

Let's now copy all these methods to the prototype chain of the `User` class using the `Object.assign()` static method.

```javascript
// greetAndBye Mixin
const greetAndBye = {
  // greeting method
  sayGreeting() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  },

  // goodbye method
  sayGoodBye() {
    return `Goodbye, ${this.name}`;
  },
};

// class User
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// copy greetAndBye object methods
// to prototype of User class
Object.assign(User.prototype, greetAndBye);

// make an object
const John = new User("John");

// invoke mixin methods
console.log(John.sayGreeting());
console.log(John.sayGoodBye());
```

Now you can call the mixin methods we copied to the prototype chain of `User` class.

- The `greetAndBye` object here is called a mixin.
- We are not doing any inheritance but copying of all the methods to the prototype chain of the `User` class.
- Mixins can be attached to more than one class.
