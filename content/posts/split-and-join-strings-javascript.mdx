The `split()` method splits a large string into an array of strings and the `join()` method joins an array of elements into a string.

---

## `split` method

```javascript
const str = "How are you ?";
```

Let's say you have a string like this. Let's separate this string using the `split` string method.

The `split` method takes a separator as an argument.

```javascript
const str = "How are you ?";

str.split(" "); // Result: ["How","are","you","?"]
```

- The `split` method separates the strings when it encounters the separating string, in this case, a blank space.
- It returns an array of strings.
- This is a string only method.

## `join` method

```javascript
const nameArray = ["John", "Helen", "Roy", "Lily"];
```

The elements of `nameArray` can be joined using the `join` method.

```javascript
const nameArray = ["John", "Helen", "Roy", "Lily"];
nameArray.join(); // Result: John,Helen,Roy,Lily
```

- If nothing is provided as an argument into the `join` method, it uses `,` (comma) as the default separator.
- It returns a string.
- This is an array only method.

Let's now use `-` as a separator in the `join` method and see the result.

```javascript
const nameArray = ["John", "Helen", "Roy", "Lily"];
nameArray.join("-"); // Result: John-Helen-Roy-Lily
```
