## Change the branch name locally

There is 2 scenarios here:

### Scenario 1: If you are on the branch

If you are on the branch which you want to change the name then you can use this

```bash
git branch -m new-name-of-branch
```

command.

### Scenario 2: If you are on another branch

If you are on another branch but want to change the name of a specific branch then you can use this

```bash
git branch -m old-name-of-branch new-name-of-branch
```

command.

## Change the branch name remotely

After changing the name of the branch locally in git, now you may want to get the same name reflected remotely like in GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc, Git hosting services.

To do that first, you need to delete the old branch in remote, you can do this with this command,

## 🚀 NOTE: BEFORE DELETING ANY REMOTE BRANCHES ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST CODE CONTENT LOCALLY.

```bash
git push origin --delete old-name-of-branch
```

Then you need to push the newly renamed local branch to remote, to do that you can use this,

```bash
git push origin new-name-of-branch
```

And lastly, you need to reset the upstream branch for the new local branch. You can achieve this using this,

```bash
git push origin -u new-name-of-branch
```

This is done to keep the sync between the remote and local branches.

This is what I do personally to rename the branches in my projects ✅.

That's all! 🌟
