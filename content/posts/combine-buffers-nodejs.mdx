To combine `Buffer` instances in Node.js, we can use the `concat()` method in the `Buffer` class.

Let's say we have 3 Buffer instances with 10 bytes of memory allocated like this,

```javascript
// Buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 3
const buff3 = Buffer.alloc(10);
```

Now we need to combine these buffers into a single buffer.

- The `concat()` method requires 2 arguments, the first one being an array of buffer instances that we want to combine and the second argument being the total bytes of the combined buffer instances.

- To get the total bytes of a buffer instance we can use the `length` property available int the buffer instance.

```javascript
// Buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 3
const buff3 = Buffer.alloc(10);

// get the total bytes
const totalBytes = buff1.length + buff2.length + buff3.length;
```

Now let's combine these instances using the `concat()` method to combine these buffers into a single buffer like this,

```javascript
// Buffer 1
const buff1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 2
const buff2 = Buffer.alloc(10);
// Buffer 3
const buff3 = Buffer.alloc(10);

// get the total bytes
const totalBytes = buff1.length + buff2.length + buff3.length;

// pass buffers an an array as the first argument
// total bytes as the second argument
const resultBuffer = Buffer.concat([buff1, buff2, buff3], totalBytes);
```

- The `concat()` method returns a new combined buffer instance.
