The `flatMap()` is an array method and is used to do some operation before converting a multidimementional array into a single array.

Suppose we have an array of sentences like this,

```javascript
// an array of sentences
let arr = [
  "Hello, How are you?",
  "Harry is a good man",
  "Hey, John",
  "I'm Fine",
];
```

What if we want to split all the words by spaces?

We can do that using the `map()` and `split()` methods like this.

```javascript
// an array of sentences
let arr = [
  "Hello, How are you?",
  "Harry is a good man",
  "Hey, John",
  "I'm Fine",
];

// loop through every elements using map
// and then split each array element by space
let newArr = arr.map((element) => {
  return element.split(" ");
});

console.log(newArr);
```

Now if we look into the array, we can see something like this,

```
[
    ["Hello,", "How", "are", "you?"],
    ["Harry", "is", "a", "good", "man"],
    ["Hey,", "John"],
    ["I'am", "Fine"]
]
```

Here we have all the words in a nested array. But we never wanted our words to be in a nested array.
The `split()` method inside the `map()` method always returns every element inside a nested array, That's a problem for us.

That's where the `flatMap()` method comes to help us.

The `flatMap()` method first maps through every element in an array and then converts every nested array elements into a single non-dimensional array.

Let's try what we did before with the `flatMap()` array method.

```javascript
// an array of sentences
let arr = [
  "Hello, How are you?",
  "Harry is a good man",
  "Hey, John",
  "I'm Fine",
];

// flatMap() method first maps through every element
// and then converts nested array into single array
let newArr = arr.flatMap((element) => {
  return element.split(" ");
});

console.log(newArr);
```

This is the output,

```
// everything in a single array
[
    "Hello,",
     "How",
     "are",
     "you?",
     "Harry",
     "is",
    "a",
    "good",
    "man",
    "Hey,",
    "John",
    "I'am",
    "Fine"
]
```

The `flatMap()` method accepts a callback function and passes the current element which is getting looped.

This code is more elegant and readable than our previous code.

The `flatMap()` does the job of mapping through the array first and then converts a nested array into a single array.
