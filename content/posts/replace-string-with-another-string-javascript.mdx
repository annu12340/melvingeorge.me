We can use the `replace` string method to replace a string with another string in JavaScript.

---

Consider this string.

```javascript
const greeting = "Hi, Friend";
```

Let's replace the string `Hi` to `Hello`.

```javascript
const greeting = "Hi, Friend";

// replacing string Hi to Hello
greeting.replace("Hi", "Hello"); // Result: Hello, friend
```

- The method accepts the string to replace as the first argument.
- And the string to be replaced with as the second argument.
- It returns a string with the replaced string.
- The method also accepts [Regular expression](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp) as the first argument.
- It is a string only method.

### Using regular expression

We can also replace all the occurrences of a specific word in a string using a regular expression.

```javascript
const favoriteLine = "Blue has 3 Blue bottles";

// all occurences of Blue will be replaced by Green
str.replace(/blue/gi, "Green"); // Result: Green has 3 Green bottles
```
