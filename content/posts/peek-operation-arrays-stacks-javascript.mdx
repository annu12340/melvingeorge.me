The `peek()` method is used to only view the last element of an array or view the recently added element in a stack data structure.

Unfortunately, there is no method called `peek()` in the `Array` object. We have to implement it ourselves in JavaScript.

All we have to do is get the last element but do not remove it.

It can be done like this,

```javascript
const lastElement = array[array.length - 1];
```

But if you want to add this as a method to the `Array` object, you have to add this as a method to the `Array` prototype chain.

So let's add our `peek()` method to the `Array` prototype chain,

```javascript
// Adding peek method to the Array
// prototype chain
Array.prototype.peek = function () {
  if (this.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("out of bounds");
  }
  return this[this.length - 1];
};
```

The function first checks whether the length of the array is `0`, If it is `true` then it will make an Error, if its `false` then it will return the last element.

Now you can use the `peek()` method just like how you would use the `push()`, `pop()` array methods.

```javascript
// Adding peek method to the Array
// prototype chain
Array.prototype.peek = function () {
  if (this.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("out of bounds");
  }
  return this[this.length - 1];
};

// array
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// peek() method
const element = arr.peek();
console.log(element); // 6
```
