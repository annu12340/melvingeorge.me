Getters and setters in objects feel like real properties but it's not real properties but a computed property.

First, Let me tell what a getter in the object is.

Consider this object `John`,

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
};
```

So this is a good old object with properties `firstName`, `lastname`, `baseSalary`, and `allowance`.

What if we need another property called `grossSalary` which is the total of `baseSalary` and `allowance` in the object `John`, but without defining an actual property on the `John` object.

So that we can get the value of `grossSalary` by calling `John.grossSalary`.

Here, we can use the concept of a getter in an object.

To make a getter in the object you need to use the `get` keyword followed by the property name that we can call in the object.

let's make a getter called `grossSalary`.

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
  // getter grossSalary
  // this returns baseSalary + allowance
  get grossSalary() {
    return this.baseSalary + this.allowance;
  },
};
```

Now if you try to call `John.grossSalary` it returns the value by adding the `baseSalary` property and `allowance` property.

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
  // getter grossSalary
  // this returns baseSalary + allowance
  get grossSalary() {
    return this.baseSalary + this.allowance;
  },
};

// get grossSalary
// just like calling a regular property
console.log(John.grossSalary);
```

This is why it is also called as computed properties. Because the `grossSalary` is not a property but a computed property of `baseSalary` property and `allowance` property.

Yeah! 🚀 We made a Getter.

Now, let's understand what a setter in an object is.

Just from the word itself, it means it's used to set a property value.

To make a setter in an object you need to use the `set` keyword followed by the property name that we can call in the object.

Let's define a setter called `fullName`.

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
  // getter grossSalary
  // this returns baseSalary + allowance
  get grossSalary() {
    return this.baseSalary + this.allowance;
  },

  // setter fullName
  // this sets the value for both the firstName and lastName property
  set fullName(fullName) {
    // we are splitting the fullname by space
    // split method returns an array
    const namesArr = fullName.split(" ");
    this.firstName = namesArr[0];
    this.lastName = namesArr[1];
  },
};
```

We have defined a setter called `fullName` which sets the value for `firstName` and `lastName` properties by splitting up the full name value by a space `" "`.

So lets set a value for `fullName` property.

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
  // getter grossSalary
  // this returns baseSalary + allowance
  get grossSalary() {
    return this.baseSalary + this.allowance;
  },

  // setter fullName
  // this sets the value for both the firstName and lastName property
  set fullName(fullName) {
    // we are splitting the fullname by space
    // split method returns an array
    const namesArr = fullName.split(" ");
    this.firstName = namesArr[0];
    this.lastName = namesArr[1];
  },
};

// lets set value for fullName
// which actually sets value for firstName and lastName property
John.fullName = "Lily Rose";

// see the contents of John object
console.log(John);
```

Now if you look into the contents of `John` object you can see that the `firstName` and `lastName` properties values are changed.

A bit of quick advice to you is that if you are making a setter it's better to make a getter for it.

Let's make a getter for `fullName` property.

```javascript
// John Object
const John = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  baseSalary: 23000,
  allowance: 3000,
  // getter grossSalary
  // this returns baseSalary + allowance
  get grossSalary() {
    return this.baseSalary + this.allowance;
  },

  // setter fullName
  // this sets the value for both the firstName and lastName property
  set fullName(fullName) {
    // we are splitting the fullname by space
    // split method returns an array
    const namesArr = fullName.split(" ");
    this.firstName = namesArr[0];
    this.lastName = namesArr[1];
  },

  // getter fullName
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

// lets set value for fullName
// which actually sets value for firstName and lastName property
John.fullName = "Lily Rose";

console.log(John.fullName);
```
