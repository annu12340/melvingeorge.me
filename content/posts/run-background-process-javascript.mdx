To run background processes or those process which has a low priority in JavaScript, You can use the `requestIdleCallback()` method.

This method helps to postpone some of the processes which are not super important like processes that involve sending analytics data to the server, caching images, etc.

When using the `requestIdleCallback()`, the processes are executed only when the main thread is free or when the user is inactive.

To use this first you have to check whether this method is available in the current browser context.

```javascript
if ("requestIdleCallback()" in window) {
  // if method exists
  // do some work
} else {
  // just do the work
  // by using a polyfill or a shim
}
```

- After checking, You need to call the `requestIdleCallback()` method.
- Pass a callback function as the first argument.

```javascript
// function for low priority job
function myLowPriorityJob() {
  console.log("Hey, I'm Processing my low priority job now 🦄!");
}

if ("requestIdleCallback" in window) {
  // if method exists
  // do some work

  // call method requestIdleCallback() and
  // passing myLowPriorityJob() callback function
  // as first argument.
  requestIdleCallback(myLowPriorityJob);
} else {
  // just do the work
  // by using a polyfill or a shim
}
```

If you want to run your process no matter what after a certain amount of time, you can pass an options object with `timeout` property as the second argument to the `requestIdleCallback()` method.

```javascript
// function for low priority job
function myLowPriorityJob() {
  console.log("Hey, I'm Processng my low priority job now 🦄!");
}

if ("requestIdleCallback" in window) {
  // passing object with timeout property
  // as the second argument
  // to make sure your process gets called after 4 seconds
  requestIdleCallback(myLowPriorityJob, { timeout: 4000 });
} else {
  // just do the work
  // by using a polyfill or a shim
}
```

### _NOTE: Use timeout only when necessary, using it everywhere without any reason may cause the whole process of your program to slow down._
