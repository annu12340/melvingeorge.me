To do arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc you need to overwrite the default `valueOf()` method in the object.

Consider 2 objects `John` and `Lily` with `name` and `salary` properties defined in it.

```javascript
// 2 objects
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  salary: 23000,
};
const Lily = {
  name: "Lily Rose",
  salary: 45000,
};
```

What would you think if we try to add these 2 objects together?
Let's find out.

```javascript
// 2 objects
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  salary: 23000,
};
const Lily = {
  name: "Lily Rose",
  salary: 45000,
};

// add 2 objects together
console.log(John + Lily); // ==> [object Object][object Object] 😟
```

Well, we would get something like this, `[object Object][object Object]`.
Not useful at all.

We can make this useful by overwriting the default `valueOf()` method in `John` and `Lily` objects, because when doing an arithmetic calculation (+, -, \*, /) with objects JavaScript internally calls `valueOf()` method.

So let's define the method in both the objects.

```javascript
// 2 objects
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  salary: 23000,
  valueOf: function () {
    return this.salary;
  },
};
const Lily = {
  name: "Lily Rose",
  salary: 45000,
  valueOf: function () {
    return this.salary;
  },
};

// add 2 objects together
console.log(John + Lily); // ==> 68000 😃

// calculate 500 + John
console.log(500 + John); // ==> 23500
```

In the `valueOf()` method we are returning the `salary` property value so that when we do numerical calculations with the objects the calculated value of both the salary is returned instead of `[object Object][object Object]`.

Useful! Right? 😃

This also depends on the context you are using to calculate.

Consider adding a string `Hello` to `John` object.

```javascript
// 2 objects
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  salary: 23000,
  valueOf: function () {
    return this.salary;
  },
};
const Lily = {
  name: "Lily Rose",
  salary: 45000,
  valueOf: function () {
    return this.salary;
  },
};

// add Hello with John
console.log("Hello" + John); // ==> Hello23000
```
