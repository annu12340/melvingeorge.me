To copy contents from one `Buffer` instance to another, we can use the `copy()` method in the `Buffer` instance in Node.js.

Let's say we have 2 `Buffer` instances from strings `Hai John` and `Hello Roy` like this,

```javascript
// Buffer 1
const strBuff1 = Buffer.from("Hai John");

// Buffer 2
const strBuff2 = Buffer.from("Hello Roy");
```

We need to copy the `Roy` part from the `strBuff2` instance to the `strBuff1` instance and paste it from the first position of the `strBuff1` object.

Let's look at how it is done using the `copy()` in the `strBuff2` object.

```javascript
// Buffer 1
const strBuff1 = Buffer.from("Hai John");

// Buffer 2
const strBuff2 = Buffer.from("Hello Roy");

// copy the Roy part from strBuff2
strBuff2.copy(strBuff1, 0, 6, 9);

// display the contents in strBuff1
console.log(strBuff1.toString());
```

### The above line reads like this: " Copy the contents from the byte 6 till byte 9 in the strBuff2 instance and paste it into the byte 0 of strBuff1 ".

The method:

- Accepts a valid `Buffer` instance to copy to (i.e `strBuff1`) as the first argument.
- Accepts a starting point in the target buffer (i.e `strBuff1`) to start pasting the content as the second argument.
- Accepts a starting point in the source buffer (i.e `strBuff2`) to copy from as the third argument.
- Accepts an ending point in the source buffer (i.e `strBuff2`) as the fourth argument.
