To convert an object to string in JavaScript you need to overwrite the default `toString()` method in any object.

All the objects in JavaScript have a default `toString()` method defined.

But that doesn't do any good for us.

Let's say we have an object `John` with `name` and `age` properties.

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

alert(John); // [object Object] 😟 Not good.
```

Because when we try to `alert(John)` it will show `[object Object]`. That's not useful for anything. But what if don't want to return `[object Object]` but return just the `name` property instead.

Well we can do that by overwriting the `toString()` method and returning the `name` property in the `John` object like this,

```javascript
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
  toString: function () {
    return this.name;
  },
};

// only name property is returned
alert(John); // John Doe

// If we try to call the default toString() method
// console.log(John) will return ==> [object Object] which is not useful at all
// Since we have overwrote the default toString() method it will return ==> John Doe
console.log(John.toString()); // John Doe
```

In the `alert()` method ,if you try to execute the code it will show `John Doe`. Yes, JavaScript internally calls the `toString()` method when `alert()` is called.

In the second case if we didn't overwrite the default `toString()` method in The `John` object it will return `[object Object]` which is not useful at all, Now we have a useful `toString()` method which returns the `name` property.

Now, Try executing `console.log(John.toString())` without defining a `toString()` method in `John` object and observe the result like this.

```javascript
// No toString() method defined
const John = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
};

console.log(John.toString()); // [object Object]   ,😟 Not useful
```
