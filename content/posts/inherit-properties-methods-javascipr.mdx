Consider a base class (constructor function) called `Vehicle` which we will use to inherit the properties from.

```javascript
// Vehicle base class
const Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {
  this.type = type;
  this.year = year;
  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;
};
```

Let's make another class called `Car` and inherit the properties from the `Vehicle` class using the `call()` method available in the `Vehicle` constructor function or class.

```javascript
// Vehicle base class
const Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {
  this.type = type;
  this.year = year;
  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;
};

// Car class
const Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {
  // inheriting properties
  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);
  this.name = name;
};
```

The `call()` method available in the `Vehicle` class is used to inherit the properties and methods from the `Vehicle` class.

- The method accepts the context to call the function as the first argument in our case we provided the `this` keyword so that context of the `Vehicle` class is now the `Car` class.
- The remaining parameters in the `call()` method are supplied to `Vehicle` class to populate its appropriate field, in our case `type`, `year`, and `numberOfTyres` fields.

Now let's make an instance of `Car` using the `new` keyword and supplying required values to it.

```javascript
// Vehicle base class
const Vehicle = function (type, year, numberOfTyres) {
  this.type = type;
  this.year = year;
  this.numberOfTyres = numberOfTyres;
};

// Car
const Car = function (name, type, year, numberOfTyres) {
  // inheriting properties
  Vehicle.call(this, type, year, numberOfTyres);
  this.name = name;
};

// Make an instance of Car
const BMW = new Car("BMW", "car", 2020, 4);
```

If we look into the contents inside the `BMW` object we can now see all the properties which were defined in the `Vehicle` and `Car` classes

```javascript
console.log(BMW);

/*

Result:
-------

{
    name: "BMW"
    numberOfTyres: 4
    type: "car"
    year: 2020
}


/*
```

We will be discussing inheriting methods in the next post.
