In the last blog post, we discussed the [basics of class syntax in JavaScript](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/class-syntax-basics-JavaScript).

Today we will be discussing some of the nitty-gritty details on classes in JavaScript.

We know how to make a class, constructor functions, and to make properties and methods in a class.

But now a big question you have in mind would be how is classes different from the old constructor functions? Or is it just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)?

No classes are not just a Syntactic sugar. Because the language checks if you have defined a class or a constructor function in many places.

The first evidence is you need to call the class with the `new` keyword for making objects out of it otherwise it will throw or show an error. For constructor function, we can call these without `new` keyword and no objects will be made and no errors are shown.

## Type of a class

Class in javascript is of type `function`.

You can check it like this,

```javascript
// create a class
class User {
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, guys");
  }
}

// check type of class
console.log(typeof User); // function
```

## Methods are not enumerable in a class by default

Methods in objects will not show up in `for...in` looping statement. Since they are not enumerable in classes.

```javascript
// create a class
class User {
  constructor() {
    this.category = "User";
    this.isAdmin = false;
  }
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, guys");
  }
}

// new object from User class
const John = new User();

// loop using for...in statement
for (let properties in John) {
  console.log(properties); // only properties are looped not methods
}
```

Methods are automatically added to the prototype chain instead of getting added to the object directly.

## Class can be defined as an expression

Classes can also be written as an expression

```javascript
// class an an expression
const User = class {
  constructor() {
    this.category = "User";
    this.isAdmin = false;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, guys");
  }
};
```

Or,

```javascript
// class an an expression
const User = class UserClass {
  constructor() {
    this.category = "User";
    this.isAdmin = false;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, guys");
  }
};
```

## Getters and setters in Class

We can also define [getters and setters](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/getters-and-setters-javascript) in class,

```javascript
// class an an expression
const User = class UserClass {
  constructor() {
    this.category = "User";
    this.isAdmin = false;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, guys");
  }

  // getter for virtual property name
  set name(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  // setter for virtual property name
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
};
```
